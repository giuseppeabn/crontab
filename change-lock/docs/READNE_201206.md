## Inspired by

- [Linux Crontab](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples)


## Crontab Config Format

```
MIN-HOUR-DOM-MON-DOW-TIMEZONE
```

OR

Can be multiple values like this

```
MIN,MIN-HOUR,HOUR-DOM,DOM-MON,MON-DOW,DOW-TIMEZONE
```

- MIN represents minute(s), can be 0 through 59
  . `*` means every minute
- HOUR represents hour(s) of a day, can be 0 through 23. `*` means every hour
- DOM represents day of month, can be 1 through 31. `*` means every day
- MON represents month, can be 1 through 12. `*` means every month
- DOW represents day of week, can be 1 through 7. 1 is Monday, 2 is Tusday and so on. `*` means every day
- TIMEZONE represent the timezone that crontab will refer to when it triggers tasks. Unfortunately, We only support 'utc timezone'. But we're working hard to improve this.
- Each sort of time value(s) must be separated by a hyphen '-'
- Multiple values must be separated by comma ','


## Basic Example

Reactjs-crontab has very similar pattern to [Linux Crontab](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples)Except that this uses hyphen between arguments like this `*-*-*-*-*-utc`.


```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BasicCron } from 'reactjs-crontab'
import 'reactjs-crontab/dist/index.css'

const sayHello = () => {
  console.log('Hello')
}

const sayGoobye = () => {
  console.log('Goodbye')
}

const RequestSomething = () => {
  console.log('Api request has been sent')
}

const sendNotification = () => {
  console.log('Send Event Notification')
}

const logUserOut = () => {
  console.log('log user out')
}

// these are the functions which will run according to your settings

const tasks = [
  // just put this array into BasicCron component as a props and it will work like magic!
  {
    fn: sayHello,
    id: '1',
    config: '*-*-*-*-*-utc',
    // Execute every minutes
    name: 'Say Hello',
    description: 'Say Hello on console'
  },
  {
    fn: sayGoobye,
    id: '2',
    config: '5-7-12-11-*-utc',
    // Execute In November on 12th At 7AM and At 5 minute(s)

    name: 'Say Goodbye',
    description: 'Say Goodbye on console'
  },
  {
    fn: RequestSomething,
    id: '3',
    config: '*-15,19-*-11,12-*-utc',
    // Execute In November, December At 3PM, 7PM every minute
    name: 'Request Something',
    description: 'Send API'
  },
  {
    fn: sendNotification,
    id: '4',
    config: '10-11-18-7-*-utc',
    // Execute In July on 18th At 11AM and At 10 minute(s)
    name: 'Send Notification',
    description: 'Send Event Notification'
  },
  {
    fn: logUserOut,
    id: '5',
    config: '*-16-*-10-1-utc',
    // Execute In October on Monday At 4PM every minute
    name: 'Log user out'
  }
]

const App = () => {
  // this will scheduled tasks
  return <BasicCron tasks={tasks} />
}

export default App
```

Copying and pasting above code will result something like this below

And That's it. This will do what it says.















## Helper (Guide) Component

Simply import CronGuide and css and that's all.
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { CronGuide } from 'reactjs-crontab'
import 'reactjs-crontab/dist/index.css'

const App = () => {
  return <CronGuide />
}

export default App
```

![Crontab Guide Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnscoding/reactjs-crontab/HEAD/assets/cronGuide.png)

This component is created to help you understand how to configure your crontab. 
Even if you are aware of such function, This would make it easier to set your crontab up and running.


## API

```
BasicCron Props {
  tasks [
    {
      fn: yourFn, // (required field) type function
      id: '1', // (required field) type string
      config: '*-11-18-10,13-*-utc', // (required field) type string
      name: 'logUserOut', // (optional field) type string
      description: 'Send API' // (optional field) type string
    }
  ]
}


```

## Important Note
Unfortunately, We only support 'utc timezone' at the moment. But we're working hard to improve this.
